## About SCP-9786
In this game you control a scientist, who's been deployed by the SCP-Foundation to investigate, 
classify and contain the anomaly known as SCP-9786. 
Through interaction with in-game objects, the player can uncover information about SCP-9786.
But whether they made the right choices turns out only at the end of the game, as each interaction
gives them positive or negative points,
and they can never be sure how many actions they have at their disposal.

*If you don't know abou the SCP-Foundation, check it out! It's quite cool* ðŸ˜Š
